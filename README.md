# Auth GraphQL: Identity and access management (IAM)

Auth GraphQL is a simple user identity and access management (IAM) app based on React.js, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB and GraphQL. The focus here is to handle queries like signup, login, logout, authorization with GraphQL.

`GraphQL is a query language for your API, and a server-side runtime for executing queries by using a type system you define for your data. GraphQL isn't tied to any specific database or storage engine and is instead backed by your existing code and data. (Source: https://graphql.org/learn)`

To get started developing right away:

* clone or fork project
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* create free MongoDB on mlab.com
* add MongoDB path to `MONGO_URI` in `/server/server.js`
* npm run dev

## Important

This project is based on Stephen Grider's `GraphQL with React` tutorial.
